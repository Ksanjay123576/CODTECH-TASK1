**Overview of the Basic Calculator Project:**

Project Objective
The main goal of this project is to create a Python-based command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It will prompt the user for input and display results interactively.

**Key Features:**

**User Input:** Accept two numerical inputs from the user.
Allow the user to select an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

**Arithmetic Operations:** Perform the chosen operation on the two numbers.
Handle edge cases, such as division by zero.

**Error Handling:** Validate inputs to ensure they are numbers.
Display meaningful error messages for invalid inputs.

**User-Friendly Interface:** Present a clear menu for selecting operations.
Display results in a simple, readable format.

**Functional Flow:**

**Welcome Message:** Greet the user and explain the functionality of the calculator.

**Input Phase:** Prompt the user to enter the first and second numbers.
Present a menu of operations to choose from.

**Processing Phase:** Perform the selected arithmetic operation.
Check for invalid inputs, such as non-numeric values or division by zero.

**Output Phase:** Display the result of the calculation.
Allow the user to perform another calculation or exit the program.
Technology Stack

**Programming Language:** Python

**Libraries:** No external libraries are required; the project relies on Python's built-in capabilities.
Target Audience
Beginner programmers looking to practice Python basics.
Individuals needing a simple command-line calculator for quick calculations.

**Key Learning Outcomes:**

**User Input Handling:** How to capture and validate input from users.

**Control Flow:** Using conditional statements (if, elif, else) to handle different cases.

**Arithmetic Operations:** Implementing basic mathematical calculations programmatically.

**Error Handling:** Using try and except blocks to manage potential runtime errors.
Possible Enhancements
Adding advanced operations like exponentiation or square roots.
Allowing multiple operations in a single input (e.g., 2 + 3 * 4).

Implementing a GUI version of the calculator.
